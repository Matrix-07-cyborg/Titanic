# About
The repository contains scripts and tools for conducting "Predictive Analysis and Data Exploration of Titanic Passenger Survival" using R programming. Here i added the word document of the 
outcomes of this project
# Objective of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to utilize the Titanic dataset to:

Perform comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends in the data that may influence passenger survival.
Engineer new features to enhance the predictive power of the dataset.
Train a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest classifier, to predict passenger survival based on available features.
Evaluate the performance of the predictive model using appropriate metrics and visualize the results.
Provide insights and conclusions that can inform future research and practical applications in disaster management and safety protocols.
